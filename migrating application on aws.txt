###### Choose proper AWS Server for Migration & create testing Env ###### 
after getting the server requirement, we can choose the proper server on AWS for migration.
if our existing application is on VM so we can create a testing environment on AWS from VM Import/Export to import virtual machine to EC2 Instance.


###### Migration ###### 
We can start with apache web server, Apache tomcat with active MQ, we can create a EC2 Instance with VPC & EBS storage and check the server with few hits & configure the database on testing environment which we have imported from vm
for DB migration, oracle & mongoDB what we can do is we can use aws rds for oracle & 1 ec2 instance for mongoDB.
we can use aws database migration service for oracle to rds or we can simply create 2 ec2 instance for oracle & mongoDB & dump data in ec2 instance.

###### load balancing ###### 
we can use AWS Elastic Load Balancers.

###### High Availability ######
